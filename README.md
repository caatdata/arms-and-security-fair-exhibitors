# Arms & Security Fair Exhibitor Data

Data about arms and security trade fairs and the companies that exhibit at them.

A collaborative project between [Campaign Against Arms Trade](https://caat.org.uk) and [Omega Research Foundation](https://omegaresearchfoundation.org/).


## Online Browsers

This data can be explored interactively at:

-   [CAAT's Arms Fair Factfiles](https://caat.org.uk/data/arms-fairs)

## What is considered an arms and security fair?

We include here events which feature an ‘exhibition’ or are attended by ‘exhibitors’, and which meet either of the following criteria:

Events that specifically invite or categorise exhibitors in the sectors of “defence”, “security”, “military”, “policing” or “hunting”.

Events attended by, or organised in collaboration with, state organisations that facilitate the export of controlled goods, for example the Export Control Joint Unit in the United Kingdom.


## What companies are listed here?

We aim to include complete exhibitor lists for the events described above. Not all companies in these listings are arms companies; some provide purely military products and services while others provide products and services intended primarily for the civilian market but which may have military applications. There are also some notable companies in military-adjacent but benevolent fields such as search and rescue or mine clearance.

In most cases, data is presented verbatim without an attempt to correct spelling errors or update company names that have been superceded by rebranding or acquisition. Logical errors, for example where a company's country has been listed as its name, and vice versa, have been corrected when encountered. Every effort has been made on our part to ensure that exhibitor lists represent the most up-to-date available data.


## How complete is this dataset?

Our research has so far produced a list of approximately 1750 unique arms and security fairs that are known to have taken place. Of these, around 500 are included in this repository, and roughly 200 of these have complete exhibitor lists (see the *Statistics* sections below for more precise figures).

Thus, at this stage the dataset is far from complete and in general it would not be appropriate to use it for comparative analysis.

However, this project is ongoing and our intention is move gradually towards completion as our resources allow.


## Who is responsible for this dataset?
